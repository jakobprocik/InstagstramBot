# Welcome my InstagramBot / Why this Bot

Hi! This was my first Project regarding Selenium. The Idea was from a classmate, who suggests, that if you follow someone on Instagram that most of the time are following you back. So my Goal was it to post to create a new Instagram Account and post nothing just running these bot and see how far I could make it. In 15 Days I got nearly 200 Followers. 

# Requirements

 - Selenium
 - Requests
 - Beautifulsoup4

## Create files and folders

There is no need to create other files or folders. Just alter the Code as you please and start run this Bot. 
But before that, you have to Scrape some Users. I would suggest that you use the biggest accounts on Instagram like @selenagomez and scrape like 5000 Users and do a quick run. 
## Some Additional Info
Do not forget to download the chrome driver to run this project.  
**Project was for demonstration/learning purposes only**
